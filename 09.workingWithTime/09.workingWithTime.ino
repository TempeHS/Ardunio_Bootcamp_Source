   Learning Intention: The students understand how time is used in microcontrollers and best practices
    1. I understand why delay(1000) whilst easy is not the preferred way of time event management
    2. I can use the millis() method and binary logic to trigger events by time
    3. I can explain the difference and benefits in serial monitor plotting by using millis() compared to delay()
    4. I understand how time can be used to send a communication frequency by using micros()

  Student Notes: 
  Comparison Operators
    - != (not equal to)
    - < (less than)
    - <= (less than or equal to)
    - == (equal to)
    - > (greater than)
    - >= (greater than or equal to)

    Boolean Operators
    - ! (logical not)
    - && (logical and)
    - || (logical or)
