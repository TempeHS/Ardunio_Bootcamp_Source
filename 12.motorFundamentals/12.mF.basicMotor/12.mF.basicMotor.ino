  Learning Intention: The students will learn how to connect and control two direct wired motors.
  Success Criteria:
    1. I can wire two basic motors
    2. I understand that the reverse polarity is why they spin in different directions
    3. I can control the motor speed with a potentiometer
    4. I understand that this is a rarely needed use case for motors and a microcontroller
