  Learning Intention: The students will learn how to connect and control a continuous 360-degree servo.
  Success Criteria:
    1. I understand how to power the continuous Servo externally from the Arduino
    2. I understand the benefits of powering a motor externally
    2. I can manually write different directions and speeds to two servos
    3. I understand the advantages and disadvantages of a continuous servo over a motor and H bridge
    4. I understand that a continuous servo speed and direction is set by a frequency signal sent from the microcontroller
