  Learning Intention: The students will learn to use the I2C communication protocol to send and receive data with 2IC sensors and actuators
    1. I understand that I2C is a communication protocol
    2. I understand that each I2C needs it's own I2C Channel
    3. I understand that communicating to I2C modules is similar to the serial monitor
    4. I undersatdn I need to include the `wire-h` library
    5. I understand that I need to look at the documentation and example code for each I2C module
    6. I can sucessfully send data to the I2C OLED display
    7. I can successfully receive data from either Temperature & Humidity Sensor, Air pressure Sensor or Acceleration Sensor in the sensor kit.
