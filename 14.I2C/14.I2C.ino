  Learning Intention:
  The students will learn to use the I2C communication protocol to send and receive
  data with 2IC sensors and actuators

  Success Criteria:
    1.  I understand that I2C is a communication protocol
    2.  I understand that each I2C needs it's own I2C Channel
    3.  I understand that communicating to I2C modules is similar to the serial monitor
    4.  I understand I need to include the `wire-h` library
    5.  I understand that I need to look at the documentation and example code for each I2C module
    6.  I can sucessfully send data to the I2C OLED display
    7.  I can successfully receive data from either Temperature & Humidity Sensor, Air pressure Sensor or Acceleration Sensor in the sensor kit.
