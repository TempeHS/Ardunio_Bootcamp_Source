# TempeHS Arduino Bootcamp - TEACHER SOLUTIONS

This is the folder structure and starter files for students completing the TempeHS Arduino Bootcamp.

The bootcamp uses the **official [Arduino Sensor Kit](https://sensorkit.arduino.cc/)**: a Grove base shield and prewired modules that connect with Grove cables (no breadboard wiring needed for the kit modules). Your kit also includes a **Grove Line Finder** and a **Grove 3-pin Ultrasonic sensor**. The motor activities use real wiring with external power.

## Getting started

1. Click **Use this template** then **Create a new repository**
2. Name it using the class convention: `2027CT_Arduino_Bootcamp_FirstName.Initial` (e.g. `2027CT_Arduino_Bootcamp_Ben.J`)
3. Open your repository in a **GitHub Codespace** (the **Arduino to Codespaces Bridge** extension installs automatically)
4. Plug in your Arduino Uno, click the bridge icon in the left navigation bar, run the server, then open the bridge
5. Upload a sketch through the bridge and you are ready to code

Full setup instructions are on the learning platform: **Arduino Bootcamp, Page 1: What is Mechatronics?**

## The working rhythm

**Write** the code in your Codespace, **Upload** it to the Arduino, **Test** it with the sensor kit, then **Commit and Push** every working solution with a clear message and a photo of your build.

Each sketch's header comment lists the learning intention, success criteria and Grove ports for that activity. Folders also contain **optional breadboard schematics** (`Bootcamp-*.png`) showing how the same circuits are wired by hand without Grove modules, for anyone who wants to look under the hood.
